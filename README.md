# Markbook Project

This project is a school project for my IB Computer Science class. This is a place where teacher can update their grades for three different classes of students. They are able to see graphs and averages of how their students are doing. On the student end, students can see their grades for each class and each test in said classes.

Since there are so many students, I can't provide all of the logins here, however, here are a few if you would like to test them out. If you want all the logins email or message me and I'd be happy to send them over if you want to test it out.
